## 🌟 Motivation

In today's fast-paced digital world, it's easy to get distracted. Whether we're working, browsing Chrome, or using various tools, a quick detour to platforms like YouTube can pull us away from our focus. As a spiritual person, I wanted to read the Bhagavad Gita (BG) regularly, but I often found it hard to carve out dedicated time for it.

That's why I built the **BG for Busy** browser extension — to effortlessly integrate spirituality into my daily workflow by reading and reflecting on verses even while working.

## 🚀 Future Aspects  

Looking ahead, the **BG for Busy** extension aims to cross boundaries by evolving into an **AI-powered chatbot**. This chatbot will not only answer user queries directly from the **Bhagavad Gita** but also pull authentic content from other spiritual texts like the **Puranas**, **Vedas**, and **Bhagavatam**. The goal is to provide a reliable, AI-guided experience for anyone seeking spiritual progress, offering verified answers and **stories rooted in bhakti** rather than opinion-based content.
